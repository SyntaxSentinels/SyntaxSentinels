Developer Names:

- Mohammad Mohsin Khan
- Lucas Chen
- Dennis Fong
- Julian Cecchini
- Luigi Quattrociocchi

Date of project start: September 19th, 2024

This project is a code plagiarism detector that uses natural language processing to overcome the limitations of typical code plagiarism detectors such as MOSS.

The folders and files for this project are as follows:

docs - Documentation for the project.
refs - Reference material used for the project, including papers.
src - Source code for the project.
test - Test source code and test cases.

## Background and Motivation

Plagiarism detection for coding in academia and online competitions is becoming increasingly challenging as students develop sophisticated ways to evade traditional syntax-based analysis tools like MOSS (Measure of Software Similarity) which analyze the structure of the code. These systems struggle with advanced “semantic” plagiarism techniques, in which the code is modified structurally while retaining the same logic. As a result, many instances of code plagiarism go undetected leading to false negatives and compromising academic integrity.
