\maketitle

\plt{Reflection is an important component of getting the full benefits from a
learning experience.  Besides the intrinsic benefits of reflection, this
document will be used to help the TAs grade how well your team responded to
feedback.  Therefore, traceability between Revision 0 and Revision 1 is and
important part of the reflection exercise.  In addition, several CEAB (Canadian
Engineering Accreditation Board) Learning Outcomes (LOs) will be assessed based
on your reflections.}

\section{Changes in Response to Feedback}

\plt{Summarize the changes made over the course of the project in response to
feedback from TAs, the instructor, teammates, other teams, the project
supervisor (if present), and from user testers.}

\plt{For those teams with an external supervisor, please highlight how the feedback 
from the supervisor shaped your project.  In particular, you should highlight the 
supervisor's response to your Rev 0 demonstration to them.}

\plt{Version control can make the summary relatively easy, if you used issues
and meaningful commits.  If you feedback is in an issue, and you responded in
the issue tracker, you can point to the issue as part of explaining your
changes.  If addressing the issue required changes to code or documentation, you
can point to the specific commit that made the changes.  Although the links are
helpful for the details, you should include a label for each item of feedback so
that the reader has an idea of what each item is about without the need to click
on everything to find out.}

\plt{If you were not organized with your commits, traceability between feedback
and commits will not be feasible to capture after the fact.  You will instead
need to spend time writing down a summary of the changes made in response to
each item of feedback.}

\plt{You should address EVERY item of feedback.  A table or itemized list is
recommended.  You should record every item of feedback, along with the source of
that feedback and the change you made in response to that feedback.  The
response can be a change to your documentation, code, or development process.
The response can also be the reason why no changes were made in response to the
feedback.  To make this information manageable, you will record the feedback and
response separately for each deliverable in the sections that follow.}

\plt{If the feedback is general or incomplete, the TA (or instructor) will not
be able to grade your response to feedback.  In that case your grade on this
document, and likely the Revision 1 versions of the other documents will be
low.}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\subsection{Challenge Level}

\plt{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.  Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the course instructor.}

\subsection{Extras}

\plt{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.}

\section{Design Iteration (LO11 (PrototypeIterate))}

\plt{Explain how you arrived at your final design and implementation.  How did
the design evolve from the first version to the final version?} 

\plt{Don't just say what you changed, say why you changed it.  The needs of the
client should be part of the explanation.  For example, if you made changes in
response to usability testing, explain what the testing found and what changes
it led to.}

\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}

\plt{Reflect and justify your design decisions.  How did limitations,
 assumptions, and constraints influence your decisions?  Discuss each of these
 separately.}

\section{Economic Considerations (LO23)}

Our product targets academic institutions and code competition organizers who require tools for detecting plagiarism in programming assignments and competitions. This market is growing, particularly as the demand for academic integrity and fair competition increases.

To market the product, we would focus on partnerships with universities, colleges, and organizations that host coding competitions. Additionally, we would leverage online platforms such as LinkedIn, GitHub, and educational forums to promote the product. Demonstrations at academic conferences and workshops could also help showcase the product's capabilities.

The estimated cost to produce a sellable version of the product includes the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Amazon S3}: For storing code submissions and related data, we estimate monthly costs of \$50 based on the expected storage size and access frequency.
    \item \textbf{Amazon SQS}: For managing message queues during the plagiarism detection process, we estimate monthly costs of \$30 based on the number of messages processed.
    \item \textbf{Web Hosting}: Hosting the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS EC2 or similar) would cost approximately \$100 per month.
    \item \textbf{Domain Registration}: A yearly cost of \$15 for a custom domain.
    \item \textbf{Marketing}: An initial budget of \$1,000 for targeted ads, promotional campaigns, and outreach to academic institutions.
    \item \textbf{Development Costs}: Assuming the team is working on this part-time, we estimate \$3,000 for initial development and testing.
\end{itemize}

In total, the initial cost to produce a sellable version would be approximately \$5,000, with ongoing monthly costs of around \$180.

We would charge academic institutions and competition organizers \$500 per year for a subscription-based model, which includes access to the plagiarism detection tool and support services. To break even, we would need to acquire at least 10 paying institutions or organizations within the first year. For an open-source version, we would focus on attracting users through community engagement, detailed documentation, and contributions from developers. The potential user base includes hundreds of academic institutions and organizations globally, particularly those that emphasize academic integrity and fair competition.

\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}

\plt{This question focuses on processes and tools used for project management.}

\subsection{How Does Your Project Management Compare to Your Development Plan}

\plt{Did you follow your Development plan, with respect to the team meeting plan, 
team communication plan, team member roles and workflow plan.  Did you use the 
technology you planned on using?}

\subsection{What Went Well?}

\plt{What went well for your project management in terms of processes and 
technology?}

\subsection{What Went Wrong?}

During the process, we overestimated the kind of data we had, versus the amount
of data we truly need in order to meet the goal we envisioned. Furthermore, a
lot of requirements that were set were not checked for feasibility thoroughly.
We ended up with many requirements that had to be revised or removed, because
they provided very little benefit, and complicated the project much more than
neccessary. Due to the unclear/unneeded requirements, the system in development
had gone through many iterations with questionable design choices which were
addressed as development continued. There was a lot of delays because of the
chances from the many iterations as well. 

\subsection{What Would you Do Differently Next Time?}

In our future projects, the most important thing would be to ensure the
requirements that we elicited are clear, and ensure that they are feasible. If
we notice that there is an unfeasible requirement specified, it must be brought
up immediately, because it will end up causing a lot of delay during
development. Furthermore, requirements will be carefully considered, to ensure
that they are truly worth adding to the project. For future projects with
complex topics like machine learning, more research will also be done to truly
understand this topics so that we are able to leverage this technology to it's
full potential.

\section{Reflection on Capstone}

\plt{This question focuses on what you learned during the course of the capstone project.}

\subsection{Which Courses Were Relevant}

\plt{Which of the courses you have taken were relevant for the capstone project?}

\subsection{Knowledge/Skills Outside of Courses}

\plt{What skills/knowledge did you need to acquire for your capstone project
that was outside of the courses you took?}
