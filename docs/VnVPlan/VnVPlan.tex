% This document ... \wss{provide an introductory blurb and roadmap of the
%   Verification and Validation plan}
This document outlines the strategies and processes used to ensure that the plagiarism detection system  developed by the SyntaxSentinals team meets all functional 
and non-functional requirements. The primary goal of this plan is to build confidence in the correctness, usability, and performance of the system. It also focuses 
on identifying and mitigating potential risks, ensuring that the final product aligns with academic and competition standards.
This document is organized as follows. The general information section provides an overview of the objectives, challenges, and relevant project documents 
used throughout the V\&V process. The plan section describes the roles and responsibilities of the team members and the tools used for automated testing and verification. 
The system tests section lists the tests performed for both functional and non-functional requirements, with traceability to the SRS. 
The unit test description section details the unit testing scope, the modules tested, and the strategies for covering edge cases. Finally, the appendix contains symbolic parameters, 
survey questions (if applicable), and any other relevant information to support the V\&V process. This plan will evolve as the project progresses, with updates following the completion 
of the detailed design and implementation phases.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

% \wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
%   its general functions.}
  The software being tested is a plagiarism detection system designed to identify similarities in Python code submissions, called SyntaxSentinels. 
  This system utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze code semantics, preventing common circumvention methods 
  like adding benign lines or altering variable names. Its core function is to allow users to input code snippets and receive a plagiarism 
  report containing similarity scores, which, when compared to a threshold, indicate the likelihood of plagiarism. This tool is primarily 
  intended for use in academic and competitive environments to promote fairness and integrity in code submissions.

\subsection{Objectives}

% \wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
%   the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
%   something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
%   ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
%   just those that are most important.}
The primary objectives of this V\&V plan are to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Build confidence in the programs correctness by ensuring alignment with the SRS requirements.
  \item Show that we have met the documented safety and security requirements (SR-SAF1- SR-SAF5) in the Hazard Analysis document.
  \item Demonstrate adequate usability in the program by conducting functional and non-functional tests mentioned in this document.
\end{itemize}

Out of Scope:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Validation of any external libraries will be assumed to be handled by their maintainers.
\end{itemize}

% \wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
% the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
% if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
% worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

% \wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
% limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
% so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
% external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
% has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

% \wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
% Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
% statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
% course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
% (in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
% VnV planning exercise.}

% \wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
% can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
% proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
% been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
% You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
% Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

This project has been classified as having a General difficulty level, as agreed with the course instructor. 
Planned extras include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A user manual for instructors and administrators.
  \item Benchmarking of the tool’s effectiveness compared to MOSS.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

% \wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
%   and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
%   can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
%   is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
%   documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

% \citet{SRS}

% \wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
% how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

The following documents are critical to the development and V\&V efforts for this project.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Software Requirements Specification (SRS)}: Defines the project’s requirements, guiding both verification and validation. ~\citep{SRS}.
    \item \textbf{User Guide}: Provides operational instructions, relevant for usability testing. ~\citep{UserGuide}.
    \item \textbf{Module Guide (MG)}: Outlines the system’s architecture, essential for design verification. ~\citep{MG}.
    \item \textbf{Module Interface Specification (MIS)}: Details the internal modules and interfaces, critical for unit testing. ~\citep{MIS}.
    \item \textbf{Hazard Analysis}: Identifies potential risks, guiding validation efforts for safety and security. ~\citep{HazardAnalysis}.
\end{itemize}

  \end{center}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

The implementation verification plan focuses on ensuring the correctness and quality of the implementation phase. The plan includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unit Testing}: Each function and module will undergo unit testing using the frameworks mentioned in section 3.6 to ensure they meet functional requirements.
    \item \textbf{Static Code Analysis}: We will use static analysis tools mentioned in section 3.6 to verify code quality, adherence to coding standards, and security practices.
    \item \textbf{Code Walkthroughs}: Code walkthroughs will be held in team meetings and during the final presentation, allowing team members to inspect each other’s code for issues in logic, structure, and readability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

To streamline the verification process, the following automated testing and verification tools will be used:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Testing Framework}: A testing framework (Pytest for Python) and (Playwright for ReactJs) will be used to automate testing of individual functions, modules, and E2E.
  \item \textbf{Continuous Integration (CI) Tool}: GitHub Actions will be set up for continuous integration to ensure that tests are automatically run on new code submissions.
  \item \textbf{Code Coverage Tool}: Code coverage tools (e.g Pytest with Coverage.py) will track the extent to which the codebase has been tested, ensuring that all critical paths are covered.
  \item \textbf{Linters/Static Analysis Tools}: Linters appropriate to the project’s programming language will enforce coding standards, improving code readability and maintainability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

The software validation plan outlines the strategies for validating that the software meets the intended requirements. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Review Sessions}: Review sessions with stakeholders and user representatives will be conducted to validate that the system meets user needs and expectations.
    \item \textbf{Rev 0 Demonstration}: Shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo, we will seek feedback from stakeholders and supervisors, if applicable, to confirm that the design and initial implementation align with project goals.
    \item \textbf{End to End Testing}: We will plan E2E sessions to ensure the software works correctly from start to end and meets all functional requirements.
    \item \textbf{Performance Testing}: Once functional requirements have been implemented, non-functional requirements will be implemented then performance testing will be conducted to validate that the software meets non-functional requirements, such as response times and resource usage.
\end{itemize}

The validation process will involve gathering external data, where possible, to test the system’s accuracy and performance under realistic scenarios.

\section*{Summary}

This comprehensive plan for verification and validation addresses each phase of the project lifecycle, from requirements to implementation. By following a structured approach with well-defined roles, checklists, and automated tools, we aim to ensure a high level of quality, accuracy, and security in the final product.

\section{System Tests}

% \wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
% the contents of the subsections.}

This section outlines the system tests to be performed for both functional and non-functional requirements. 
The tests are categorized based on the area of testing, such as look and feel requirements, usability, and versioning. 
Each test includes a title, test ID, control, initial state, input, output, test case derivation, and how the test will be performed.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

Each test section addresses a particular initial condition and input set. 
Therefore, each test has a particular set of outputs that the system should 
produce for it. A functional requirement of section 9 in the SRS \citep{SRS}
is only associated with a test if the output set of the test corresponds to 
the fit criterion of that functional requirement, and the fit criterion should 
be an observable component of a system state, such as a display of a return 
item or notification presented. Through this association, every functional 
requirement is provided a test that is capable of verifying it, thereby ensuring 
the test areas fully cover the functional requirements.

\subsubsection{Plagiarism Analysis Input Upload Tests}

Applies to all FRs involving uploading code snippets to the system. This currently 
covers FR-1 in subsection 9.1 of the SRS \citep{SRS}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-FR-1\\}

Control: Automatic.
					
Initial State: system is active and set up in spot to receive code snippet 
uploads, zero or more existing snippets are currently uploaded.
					
Input: code snippet file(s).
					
Output: System signifies input was received and continues activity without 
error, awaiting further action directives (such as uploading more files or 
initiating analysis).

Test Case Derivation: The system will look to continually receive code 
snippets from user as part of a necessary step to initiate plagiarism analysis.
					
How test will be performed: A script will open the system in the appropriate spot for 
receiving code and will upload files in varying amounts, one batch at a time, all the 
while inspecting for failure during the process. Script will be integrated into CI/CD
pipeline to ensure continued system functionality (types: dynamic, functional).
					

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Plagiarism Analysis Result Tests}

Applies to all FRs involving immediate output of plagiarism analysis. This 
currently covers FR-2, FR-4, and FR-5 in subsection 9.1 of the SRS \citep{SRS}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-FR-2\\}

Control: Automatic.
					
Initial State: system is active and set up in spot for initiating analysis, 
2 or more code snippets have been uploaded.
					
Input: command to initiate analysis (button, enter, etc.).
					
Output: System presents list of similarity scores for all code snippet pairings 
along with corresponding threshold scores and any code snippet pairing that 
has exceeded its threshold has been flagged. System remains active, 
awaiting for action directives on what to do.

Test Case Derivation: The system should possess an algorithm that analyzes code 
snippets and produces similarity scores and threshold scores in return. These 
scores should be produced between every pairing of code snippets as the 
plagiarism is a relative assessment between one code piece and another. The 
system must able to pass this algorithm received code snippets and use its
results to flag any pairing that exceeded its threshold before returning from
its analysis state to the user for further interaction.

How test will be performed: A script will open the system's spot to initiate analysis 
with 2 or more code snippets already inserted into the system, and command for 
starting analysis will be entered. Errors will be inspected for 
up until similarity scores and thresholds have been presented. By this point,
code flaggings should also be available to ascertain. (type: dynamic, functional).
					

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Guide Documentation Generation Tests}

Applies to all FRs involving guide documentation generation for user. This 
currently covers FR-3 in subsection 9.1 of the SRS \citep{SRS}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-FR-3\\}

Control: Automatic.
					
Initial State: System is active and set up in spot for generating guide 
documentation.
					
Input: command for documentation presentation (button, enter, etc.).
					
Output: System generates documentation in a viewable medium, such as text or a 
PDF file, and remains active while awaiting for further action directives.

Test Case Derivation: system possesses guide documentation which it should be 
capable of transferring to user to provide guidance on use cases of system 
when prompted.

How test will be performed: A script will open the system's spot for generating 
guide documentation and command for guide generating documentation will be 
entered, all the while inspecting for error. It will check for missing 
documentation at the end. (type: dynamic, functional).				

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Report Documentation Generation Tests}

Applies to all FRs involving analysis report documentation generation for 
user. This currently covers FR-6 of subsection 9.1 of the SRS \citep{SRS}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-FR-4\\}

Control: Automatic.
					
Initial State: System is active and set up in spot for report generation, 
most recent plagiarism analysis has been completed since after system activation 
and its results are available.
					
Input: command for report documentation generation (button, enter, etc.).
					
Output: System provides report documentation in a viewable medium, such
as text or a PDF file, and remains active awaiting for further action 
directives.

Test Case Derivation: The system should possess the ability to aggregate
the results of the plagiarism analysis which has most recently occurred 
and insert them into a template that can summarize all findings to a user,
which will become the report document given.

How test will be performed: A script will have the system conduct a 
plagiarism analysis to provide inputs for the report generation as this
simulates what must happen before a user can unlock report generation. 
If successful, it will proceed to open the spot for generating a report 
where the command for generating a report will be entered, all the while 
inspecting for errors during the process. It will check for missing 
documentation at the end (type: dynamic, functional).			

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Account Creation Tests}

Applies to all FRs involving creating an account within the system. This currently
covers FR-7 of subsection 9.1 of the SRS \citep{SRS}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-FR-5\\}

Control: Automatic.
					
Initial State: system is active and set up in spot for account creation.
					
Input: command for account creation (button, enter, etc.) alongside account 
user email and password, and the email is not associated with any existing 
account.
					
Output: System indicates account creation was successfully created for 
logging in with (evidenced by existence of email within created account list)
and remains active, awaiting further action directives.

Test Case Derivation: The system should be able to assess a set of account 
credentials is not yet within the system and proceed to add this set to the 
set of accounts that can be logged in with.

How test will be performed: A script will open the system's spot for account creation, 
email and password not associated with any existing account will be given in the 
appropriate area, and command for account creation will be entered; all the while inspecting 
for any failure mode within the process. Created account will be inspected for at the end.
(type: dynamic, functional).

\item{test-FR-6\\}

Control: Automatic.
					
Initial State: system is active and set up in spot for account creation.
					
Input: command for account creation (button, enter, etc.) alongside account 
user email and password, and the email is associated with an existing 
account.
					
Output: System notifies account was not possible to create for logging 
in with and remains active, awaiting further action directives.

Test Case Derivation: A set of pre-existing account credentials should not be 
possible to create an account with. Otherwise, account creation is arbitrary 
and not truly provided by the system as any set of account credentials are not 
tied to any particular account.

How test will be performed: A script will open the system's spot for account 
creation, email and password asssociated with an existing account will be 
given in the appropriate area, and command for account creation will be 
entered; all the while inspecting for any failure mode within the process 
(type: dynamic, functional).
					

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Account Login Tests}

Applies to all FRs involving logging into account within the system. This 
currently covers FR-8 of subsection 9.1 of the SRS \citep{SRS}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-FR-7\\}

Control: Automatic.
					
Initial State: system is active and set up in spot for account 
login.
					
Input: command for account login (button, enter, etc.) alongside account 
user email and password, and the email is associated with an existing 
account.
					
Output: System notifies account login was successful and and remains 
active, awaiting further action directives.

Test Case Derivation: The system should be able to validate a set of 
pre-existing account credentials to facilitate login.

How test will be performed: A script will open the system's spot for account 
login, email and  password asssociated with existing account will be given 
in the appropriate area, and command for account login will be passed; all 
the while inspecting for any failure mode within the process (type: dynamic, 
functional).

\item{test-FR-8\\}

Control: Automatic.
					
Initial State: system is active and set up in spot for account login.
					
Input: command for account login (button, enter, etc.) alongside account 
user email and password, and the email is not associated with any existing 
account.
					
Output: System notifies account login was not successful and remains 
active, awaiting further action directives.

Test Case Derivation: A set of account credentials not associated an existing 
account will fail to allow login as the system should determine there is no 
account to validate against.

How test will be performed: A script will open system's spot for account login, 
email and password not asssociated with existing account with will be given in 
the appropriate area, and command for account login will be passed; all the 
while inspecting for any failure mode within the process (type: dynamic, functional).
					
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Result Visualization Tests}

Applies to all FRs involving visualizing plagiarism analysis results provided 
by user in a .zip file. This currently covers FR-9 of subsection 9.1 of the SRS 
\citep{SRS}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-FR-9\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: System is active and a job has been completed and is ready
to be visualized.
					
Input: None
					
Output: System provides visualization in viewable medium, such as image or file,
that corresponds to the results.

Test Case Derivation: System should possess ability to pull all relevant
data from a completed job and insert it into a visualization template that
can be presented to the user.

How test will be performed: A script will open the system's spot for result
visualization and will inspect for any failure mode within the process

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

% \wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
%   appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
%   reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
%   necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

% \wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
% passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
% the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
% the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
% table or graph.}

% \wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
%   survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

% \wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
% format for the tests given below.}

% \wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
% How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
% be involved? Be specific.}

This section outlines the system tests to be performed for non-functional requirements, including accuracy, performance, and usability.

\subsubsection{Look and Feel}

defined requirements with respect to layout, typography, component alignment,
etc. 

\begin{description}
  \item[Front End Component Review:] We will engage a developer to look through
  the code and interface and ensure components are implemented as they are
  defined in the SRS.
  \item[Accessibility Check:] A developer will review if accessibility tools
  exist or not within the application. Important tools are screen readers and
  alt text for images. Furthermore, the developer must check for sufficient
  colour contrast between components.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Validate Look and Feel User Interface Tests}

\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Usability and Humanity}
These test cases are intended to build a foundation for the user's experience
on the application. Thus, the only real way to get feedback the user experience
is to have someone use the application and provide feedback.

\begin{description}
  \item[User Test Demo:] We will engage a user to test the application, bringing
  them through a new user process, and ask for feedback on specific areas
  relevant to the requirements that were set. The feedback will be a result of a
  survey, with questions structured as "On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you
  rate X?" with X being some aspect of usability.

  \end{enumerate}
  
  \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Versioning}
These testcases are for versioning requirements that are key in order 
to roll back to old iterations of the code or old iterations of the model 
when needed. These will mainly be tested by checking if old versions are saved. 
Note that this check will be done after each iteration of the model.

    folder containing all past and current versions of models, each with an 
    associated performance report, as well as a changelog including dates of revisions
    \item This will be done with each iteration of the model code.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Privacy/Security}
These testcases ensure that the system is secure, and does not violate any
privacy rights. The tests for these requirements will revolve around doing
audits to ensure system integrity.

\begin{description}
  \item[Data Retention Audit:] We will manually check the file system and any
  logs to look for any user-generated data, or personally identifiable data.
  This audit may also be done in a test environment to check live logs of the
  system.

  ensure that they are secure. They must also check that the website uses https
  encryption (padlock symbol in address bar)
  \item[Legal Audit:] We will manually check the system to ensure that it
  adheres to legal policies defined in the SRS, such as PIPEDA and FIPPA. This
  audit will be done regularly, and with each new version release, to the best
  of our abilities.

  Output/Result: Certification that documentation is valid

  How test will be performed:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A developer will navigate to the user documentation and help pages within the 
    application. They must first ensure that documentation exists, and is easy to find.
    \item They must then verify that the documentation is correct, complete, uses clear
     non-technical language, and is helpful for users.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Performance}
These testcases ensure that the system is able to handle a certain amount of load, and that it is able to process data in a timely manner.

\paragraph{Batch processing time is less than 4 hours for assumed upper bound of classroom size}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{test-PR-1}
  
  NFR: PR-SL1, PR-C1

  Type: Performance, Dynamic

  Initial State: The system is idle and ready to process a batch of code submissions

  Input: 500 code snippets of 200 lines or less 

  Output: The system completes processing the batch within 4 hours.

  How test will be performed: Script will open system's spot for plagiarism analysis 
  and pass system 500 code snippets of 200 lines or less alongside command to initiate analysis. 
  It will use a computer timer through a library, such as pyperf, to time the interval between 
  the analysis start and the analysis return. If the interval is under 4 hours, the test will 
  return a pass. Will be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline and be run periodically to affirm 
  system health and performance over time.

  % \begin{enumerate}
  %   \item Submit a batch of code submissions to the system.
  %   \item Measure the time taken for the system to process the batch.

  false positives compared against the ground truths when using default threshold
            
  How test will be performed: 
  Script will pass current test set of code snippets and give command-line argument to 
  initiate analysis from detector. Upon return of analysis, it will compare results against 
  ground truths of test set using default threshold. If accuracy rate is 90\% and false positives 
  are lower than 5\%, the test will return a pass. This will be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline and 
  be run periodically to affirm system health and performance over time. Also, the test set will potentially
  change over time to keep any possible bias in check.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Feature Updates Do Not Degrade Performance}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{test-PR-4}

  NFR: PR-SE1

  Type: Functional, Dynamic, Regression

  Output: All base features still function as expected with new feature code in place
            
  How test will be performed: When a new feature is added to the system (as denoted in a 
  pull request or otherwise), all system tests for functional requirements
  are re-ran to ensure no previous functionality has been lost. This will be facilitated
  by a CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub actions) for all functional requirement tests.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Operational and Environmental}

  A verifiable metric is that the report exists.This test will be done manually 
  by the team members of SyntaxSentinels.

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{A pathway for users to post or vote for requests/issues}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{test-M-2}

  NFR: MS-S3

  Input: User posts a request or issue

  Output: The request or issue is posted and visible to other users

  How test will be performed:
  The user will post a request or issue and verify that it is visible to other users. 
  A verifiable metric is that the request or issue is visible to other users.
  This test will be done manually by the team members of SyntaxSentinels.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Model Code follows Template }

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{test-M-3}

  NFR: MS-A2

  Type: Inspection, Static

  Initial State: N/A

  Input: Source code pertaining to machine learning model is passed to a parsing script

  Output: The output of the parsing script states model components all follow templates

  How test will be performed:
  Source code pertaining to machine learning model will be statically checked
(through a parsing script looking for reserved class words or ordering potentially) 
to see if model contains components/layers that inherit an interface/class. If all 
components/layers are found to inherit an interface/class, it is assumed it will be simple 
to create or exchange components/layers of the model in code to keep it up with research 
without major overhaul to the model code in its entirety (although there may be significant
changes within individual components/layers). This will be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline and run
periodically to ensure model code remains in adherence to templates.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Model Code follows Template }

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{test-M-4}

  NFR: MS-A1

  Type: Dynamic 

  Initial State: System is inactive
  (cannot modify model during activity)

  Input: None into system directly, training script receives two formats of training sets

  Output: Training script successfully completes epoch 

  How test will be performed:
  Training script for model provided will receive two different formats of 
  training set data from a test script, and test script will verify training 
  occurred either through inspecting a generated checkpoint file or a return 
  value from the training script. This will be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline 
  and run periodically to ensure compatibility for model training remains.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Model Code follows Template }
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{test-M-5}

  NFR: MS-A3

  Type: Manual, Unit

  Initial State: N/A

  Input: A set of appropriately dimensioned vectors into model component/layer

  Output: Expected modification of vector according to component/layer architecture

  How test will be performed:
  Every unique model layer/component will attempt to be separated from any preceding and 
  proceeding layer/components, and will be copied into a test function where it 
  will be given an input vector of appropriate size. The output function should 
  apply transformations strictly associated with that layer and no other, which 
  should be evident through output vector size and contents of the vector. Must 
  be manually done as assessing how to separate layers may not be possible to be 
  done in a consistent manner, even if layers/components are ultimately modular. 
  The difference of having embedded layers that are not modular versus separable 
  layers is akin to having z=f(g(x)) versus y=g(x) and z=g(y). Test must only be done 
  every time a new type of model component or layer is added.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 

  While writing this deliverable, our team was able to collaboratively clarify and solidify 
  our understanding of both the functional and non-functional requirements. This process helped us align on 
  specific goals and create comprehensive test plans, which ensures that our testing will effectively verify 
  that all key project requirements are met.

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?

  A significant challenge we faced was the extensive amount of non-functional requirements (NFRs), 
  with over 30 NFRs to address. Each NFR required us to develop a detailed test plan, specifying 
  factors like type (e.g., functional, dynamic, manual), initial state, input/conditions, expected 
  output/results, and test method. While the template helped streamline our process, the sheer volume 
  of NFRs meant the documentation grew quickly, and managing this without sacrificing detail was challenging. 
  We prioritized efficiency by dividing NFRs among team members and holding review sessions to ensure consistent 
  quality and adherence to our testing criteria. This allowed us to maintain clarity without being overwhelmed by 
  the documentation demands.
  One of the main challenges we faced was the large amount of 
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

  Approaches for acquiring knowledge or mastering the skill has been identified
  above.
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lucas Chen:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Security Testing Knowledge}  
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Chosen Approach}: YouTube Tutorials and online courses
            \item \textbf{Reason for Choice}: YouTube tutorials and online courses provide a flexible and 
            accessible way to learn security testing concepts and tools. By watching tutorials and taking courses, 
            I can gain a solid understanding of security testing practices and apply them effectively in our project.
        \end{itemize}
    
        \item \textbf{Performance Testing Knowledge}  
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Chosen Approach}: Tool-Specific Training (e.g., JMeter, PostMan)
            \item \textbf{Reason for Choice}: Tool-specific training allows me to focus on the performance testing 
            tools that are most relevant to our project. By learning tools like JMeter or PostMan, I can gain practical 
            skills that directly apply to our performance testing requirements.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dennis Fong:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Automated Testing Tools}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Chosen Approach}: Online courses and textbooks
        \item \textbf{Reason for Choice}: This approach was chosen because of
        the flexibility and convenience where I can learn at my own pace.
        Furthermore, online resources are usually more up to date than textbooks
        that may be old
      \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Security Testing Knowledge}  
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Chosen Approach}: Youtube videos (theory) and online
            courses
            \item \textbf{Reason for Choice}: For security testing, the theory
            behind the foundations of security are very important. Furthermore,
            online courses also provide the knowledge, and application of these
            concepts to learn more about security testing.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Julian Cecchini:} 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Automated Testing Tools}  
      \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Chosen Approach}: Hands-on practice with sample projects
          \item \textbf{Reason for Choice}: I previously examined online tutorials 
          and articles which taught the use of jenkins and github actions. I feel the material
          gave me more comfort with the area but not everything completely snapped in place within
          my mind. Therefore, I think it would be very beneficial to make some arbitrary 
          source code which I can make a minor CI/CD pipeline for to gain a sense for
          all the nitty-gritty details involved within the setup of automated testing.
      \end{itemize}
  
      \item \textbf{Static Testing Knowledge}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Chosen Approach}: Tool-Specific Documentation and Tutorials
          \item \textbf{Reason for Choice}: I have used linters and the like before, but 
          have not explored them in-depth. I would enjoy to not just learn superficial/basic
          stuff that can be found in webinars or youtube videos but to really sink my teeth 
          into niche capabilities of linters which could possibly benefit my capstone or 
          personal projects. Therefore, I feel documentation would be the best route seeing
          that it should contain all the functionality of static analysis tools, including experimental or less commonly known/discussed aspects.
      \end{itemize}
  
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mohammad Mohsin Khan:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Dynamic Testing Knowledge}  
      \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Chosen Approach}: Hands-on practice with sample projects
          \item \textbf{Reason for Choice}: Practicing dynamic testing directly on projects will allow me to apply testing techniques in real-world scenarios, strengthening my ability to identify issues as they arise. This hands-on approach will provide practical insights that go beyond theoretical learning and help me become proficient in testing under realistic conditions.
      \end{itemize}
  
      \item \textbf{Performance Testing Knowledge}  
      \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Chosen Approach}: Tool-specific training
          \item \textbf{Reason for Choice}: Tool-specific training allows me to gain direct experience with the performance testing tools that I will use in the project. This approach is ideal because it provides both a solid understanding of tool features and the technical skills needed to set up and execute performance tests effectively.
      \end{itemize}
  
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Luigi Quattrociocchi:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Static Testing Knowledge}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Chosen Approach}: Tool-Specific Documentation and Tutorials
            \item \textbf{Reason for Choice}: Reading and following documentation and tutorials specific to static testing tools, such as ESLint, should allow me to gain a more detailed understanding of how these tools work. This approach will also make it easier for me to learn best practices for effective code analysis within the actual tool environment we'll be using.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Test Case Management}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Chosen Approach}: Exploring Test Management Tools
            \item \textbf{Reason for Choice}: Familiarizing myself with test management tools should provide me with direct experience in organizing, creating, and tracking test cases. This is especially useful for our project because having a structured approach to documentation should streamline collaboration with other team members as we conduct testing.
        \end{itemize}
