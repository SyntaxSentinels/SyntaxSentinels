\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

% This document ... \wss{provide an introductory blurb and roadmap of the
%   Verification and Validation plan}
This document outlines the strategies and processes used to ensure that the plagiarism detection system  developed by the SyntaxSentinals team meets all functional 
and non-functional requirements. The primary goal of this plan is to build confidence in the correctness, usability, and performance of the system. It also focuses 
on identifying and mitigating potential risks, ensuring that the final product aligns with academic and competition standards.
This document is organized as follows. The general information section provides an overview of the objectives, challenges, and relevant project documents 
used throughout the V\&V process. The plan section describes the roles and responsibilities of the team members and the tools used for automated testing and verification. 
The system tests section lists the tests performed for both functional and non-functional requirements, with traceability to the SRS. 
The unit test description section details the unit testing scope, the modules tested, and the strategies for covering edge cases. Finally, the appendix contains symbolic parameters, 
survey questions (if applicable), and any other relevant information to support the V\&V process. This plan will evolve as the project progresses, with updates following the completion 
of the detailed design and implementation phases.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

% \wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
%   its general functions.}
  The software being tested is a plagiarism detection system designed to identify similarities in Python code submissions, called SyntaxSentinels. 
  This system utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze code semantics, preventing common circumvention methods 
  like adding benign lines or altering variable names. Its core function is to allow users to input code snippets and receive a plagiarism 
  report containing similarity scores, which, when compared to a threshold, indicate the likelihood of plagiarism. This tool is primarily 
  intended for use in academic and competitive environments to promote fairness and integrity in code submissions.

\subsection{Objectives}

% \wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
%   the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
%   something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
%   ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
%   just those that are most important.}
The primary objectives of this V\&V plan are to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Build confidence in the programs correctness by ensuring alignment with the SRS requirements.
  \item Show that we have met the documented safety and security requirements (SR-SAF1- SR-SAF5) in the Hazard Analysis document.
  \item Demonstrate adequate usability in the program by conducting functional and non-functional tests mentioned in this document.
\end{itemize}

Out of Scope:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Validation of any external libraries will be assumed to be handled by their maintainers.
\end{itemize}

% \wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
% the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
% if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
% worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

% \wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
% limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
% so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
% external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
% has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

% \wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
% Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
% statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
% course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
% (in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
% VnV planning exercise.}

% \wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
% can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
% proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
% been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
% You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
% Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

This project has been classified as having a General difficulty level, as agreed with the course instructor. 
Planned extras include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A user manual for instructors and administrators.
  \item Benchmarking of the tool’s effectiveness compared to MOSS.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

% \wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
%   and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
%   can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
%   is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
%   documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

% \citet{SRS}

% \wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
% how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

The following documents are critical to the development and V\&V efforts for this project.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Software Requirements Specification (SRS)}: Defines the project’s requirements, guiding both verification and validation. ~\citep{SRS}.
    \item \textbf{User Guide}: Provides operational instructions, relevant for usability testing. ~\citep{UserGuide}.
    \item \textbf{Module Guide (MG)}: Outlines the system’s architecture, essential for design verification. ~\citep{MG}.
    \item \textbf{Module Interface Specification (MIS)}: Details the internal modules and interfaces, critical for unit testing. ~\citep{MIS}.
    \item \textbf{Hazard Analysis}: Identifies potential risks, guiding validation efforts for safety and security. ~\citep{HazardAnalysis}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Plan}

This section outlines the structured plan for verification and validation of the project. It defines team roles, describes approaches for verifying different phases of the development process, and specifies tools to be used in ensuring the project meets quality standards.

  \end{center}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

The implementation verification plan focuses on ensuring the correctness and quality of the implementation phase. The plan includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unit Testing}: Each function and module will undergo unit testing using the frameworks mentioned in section 3.6 to ensure they meet functional requirements.
    \item \textbf{Static Code Analysis}: We will use static analysis tools mentioned in section 3.6 to verify code quality, adherence to coding standards, and security practices.
    \item \textbf{Code Walkthroughs}: Code walkthroughs will be held in team meetings and during the final presentation, allowing team members to inspect each other’s code for issues in logic, structure, and readability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

To streamline the verification process, the following automated testing and verification tools will be used:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Testing Framework}: A testing framework (Pytest for Python) and (Playwright for ReactJs) will be used to automate testing of individual functions, modules, and E2E.
  \item \textbf{Continuous Integration (CI) Tool}: GitHub Actions will be set up for continuous integration to ensure that tests are automatically run on new code submissions.
  \item \textbf{Code Coverage Tool}: Code coverage tools (e.g Pytest with Coverage.py) will track the extent to which the codebase has been tested, ensuring that all critical paths are covered.
  \item \textbf{Linters/Static Analysis Tools}: Linters appropriate to the project’s programming language will enforce coding standards, improving code readability and maintainability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

The software validation plan outlines the strategies for validating that the software meets the intended requirements. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Review Sessions}: Review sessions with stakeholders and user representatives will be conducted to validate that the system meets user needs and expectations.
    \item \textbf{Rev 0 Demonstration}: Shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo, we will seek feedback from stakeholders and supervisors, if applicable, to confirm that the design and initial implementation align with project goals.
    \item \textbf{End to End Testing}: We will plan E2E sessions to ensure the software works correctly from start to end and meets all functional requirements.
    \item \textbf{Performance Testing}: Once functional requirements have been implemented, non-functional requirements will be implemented then performance testing will be conducted to validate that the software meets non-functional requirements, such as response times and resource usage.
\end{itemize}

The validation process will involve gathering external data, where possible, to test the system’s accuracy and performance under realistic scenarios.

\section*{Summary}

This comprehensive plan for verification and validation addresses each phase of the project lifecycle, from requirements to implementation. By following a structured approach with well-defined roles, checklists, and automated tools, we aim to ensure a high level of quality, accuracy, and security in the final product.

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

% \wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
% For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
% can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
% approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
% and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
% and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
% needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

% \subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

% \wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
%   developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on

  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 

  While writing this deliverable, our team was able to collaboratively clarify and solidify 
  our understanding of both the functional and non-functional requirements. This process helped us align on 
  specific goals and create comprehensive test plans, which ensures that our testing will effectively verify 
  that all key project requirements are met.

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?

  A significant challenge we faced was the extensive amount of non-functional requirements (NFRs), 
  with over 30 NFRs to address. Each NFR required us to develop a detailed test plan, specifying 
  factors like type (e.g., functional, dynamic, manual), initial state, input/conditions, expected 
  output/results, and test method. While the template helped streamline our process, the sheer volume 
  of NFRs meant the documentation grew quickly, and managing this without sacrificing detail was challenging. 
  We prioritized efficiency by dividing NFRs among team members and holding review sessions to ensure consistent 
  quality and adherence to our testing criteria. This allowed us to maintain clarity without being overwhelmed by 
  the documentation demands.
  One of the main challenges we faced was the large amount of 
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dynamic testing knowledge}: 
    \item \textbf{Static testing knowledge}:
    \item \textbf{Automated testing tools}: 
  \end{itemize}

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lucas Chen:} 
    \item \textbf{Dennis Fong:}
    \item \textbf{Julian Cecchini:} 
    \item \textbf{Mohammad Mohsin Khan:}
    \item \textbf{Luigi Quattrociocchi:}
\end{itemize}
