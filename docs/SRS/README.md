# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

<!-- <The SRS is for a single product, not a family of products. A Commonality Analysis is
more appropriate for a family of products.>

<The template in this folder is suited to Scientific Computing (also known as 
Research Software) projects> -->

The SRS outlines the project's purpose, which is to enhance academic integrity by providing a reliable plagiarism detection system that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The document details functional and non-functional requirements, such as user authentication, similarity scoring, and report generation, while ensuring compliance with data protection laws and ethical standards in AI development.
