This report outlines the key components of the SyntaxSentials project plan, 
starting with the adoption of an MIT license for the project. The team's meeting 
structure is detailed, including weekly meetings and monthly check-ins with the 
industry advisor. Key roles, such as chair and minute-taker, are assigned, and a 
meeting agenda template is provided for structured discussions.

The communication plan revolves around GitHub for task management and issue 
tracking, with detailed steps for issue creation, labeling, and resolution. 
Team members are assigned roles, and a workflow for merging code changes, 
performing testing, and pushing updates to production is presented. Additionally, 
a proof of concept demonstration plan highlights potential project risks. Concluding 
with expected technologies, coding standards, and a high-level project 
schedule.

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

The team will meet for at least 4 hours every week, 2 hours during the allotted tutorial 
time on Monday at 2:30 pm. Precise location will be open but the meeting will be virtually, 
otherwise on McMaster University campus. the other 2 hours allotted would be done virtually over the weekend.


Meetings will be scheduled with our industry advisor depending on their schedule virtually. 
The plan is to meet for at least 4 hours every month for guidance and to confirm that the team 
is on the right track. We hope to meet with our advisor for at least 1 hour at the end of every 
month for a recap. In person meetings with our advisor will be conducted depending on their availability.

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\subsection{Attendance Tracking}

The attendance issue will be updated for each lecture and meeting that takes place. This issue 
can be found on the project GitHub page.

\subsection{Issue Creation and Tracking}

Tasks will be issued via creating a GitHub issue. This approach ensures all task-related 
discussions and updates are in a centralized place, providing a clear record of progress. 
Each issue must include a detailed explanation, enabling all team members to understand the 
task at hand without needing further clarification. Additionally, issues will be categorized 
using labels to specify their nature. The available labels are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Documentation}: For tasks related to documentation.
    \item \textbf{Bug}: For resolving errors or malfunctions.
    \item \textbf{New Feature}: For implementing new functionalities.
    \item \textbf{Enhancement}: For enhancing existing features.
    \item \textbf{Low Priority}: For tasks that are not urgent.
    \item \textbf{Med Priority}: For tasks that need attention.
    \item \textbf{High Priority}: For tasks that need immediate attention.
    \item \textbf{Spike}: For tasks that require further clarification or research/feedback.
\end{itemize}

Additional labels will be introduced as needed throughout the project. Issues will be 
assigned to the team member most suited to the task, based on their expertise. All 
relevant commits will be displayed under the issue, and it will automatically close once 
the associated pull request is merged into the main branch. Including a closing tag (e.g., "closes \#12") 
in the pull request ensures proper closure of the issue. This structured process guarantees 
accountability and keeps tasks traceable.

\subsection*{Step-by-Step Process}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Open a New Issue}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Write a clear, detailed description to ensure the team fully understands what needs to 
        be done without needing additional questions or clarification.
        \item At this stage, the team can discuss what needs to be done, identify the problem, 
        and determine the best course of action.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Add a Label}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Choose one of the following labels based on the task type:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Bug
            \item New Feature
            \item Enhancement
            \item Low Priority
            \item Med Priority
            \item High Priority
            \item Spike
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Assign the Issue}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assign the issue to the most relevant team member.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Once the above steps are completed, the assignee should follow the established 
process workflow. After finishing the task and submitting a pull request, they 
must ensure the pull request provides sufficient detail to demonstrate the task 
has been resolved. This could include test cases, bug fixes, or other relevant 
changes. The pull request should also include a closing tag (e.g., "closes \#12") 
to automatically close the issue and ensure proper tracking.

\section{Workflow Plan}

\subsection{Workflow to merge changes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pull changes from the main branch
    \item Run unit/E2E tests and any new test cases required for new code (Must pass a certain threshold to be approved)
    \item Create a branch with the following template, branch type/SS/ticket number. (e.g. feature/SS-01, where branch type is feature or fix or spike, SS as SyntaxSentinel and 01 is the ticket number taken from GitHub Issues board)
    \item Comment code with branch type followed by a descriptive message (e.g. feat: add database connection)
    \item Open pull request
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Must follow PR template, found on \href{https://github.com/lilweege/SyntaxSentinels/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md}{GitHub project page}
            \item Automated tests are run using GitHub Actions
            \item Reviewers ensure that code meets acceptance criteria and does not regress any test cases
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Merge the branch into main
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Workflow to push to higher environment: PROD}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Merge dev branch into SIT branch
    \item Perform regression test and manually verify complex workflow
    \item Merge SIT branch into PROD branch
    \item Validate changes are in production
\end{enumerate}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

% \wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
% libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
% the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
% libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
% learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

% \wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
% of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
% it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
% choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
% implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
% project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
% members will need to augment their training.}

\newpage{}

\section*{Appendix --- Team Charter}

\subsection*{External Goals}

Our team’s external goals for this project are:

To create a state-of-the-art code plagiarism detector using ML and NLP that stands out from traditional tools like MOSS.
To showcase the project at the Capstone EXPO and win a prize or recognition.
To leverage this project as a highlight in job interviews to showcase our technical and teamwork skills.
\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}

All team members are expected to attend meetings on time. Leaving early or missing meetings should only occur in exceptional circumstances, and prior notice must be given whenever possible. Virtual attendance is allowed if in-person is not feasible.

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}

Acceptable excuses include health issues, family emergencies, academic conflicts with prior notice, or unforeseen personal commitments. Unacceptable excuses are forgetfulness, lack of motivation, or missing meetings due to non-academic social activities.

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}

If a team member encounters an emergency and cannot attend a meeting or complete their assigned tasks, they should immediately inform the team via group chat (or other agreed communication tools) and arrange to cover or reschedule their tasks with another member if possible.

\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

\subsubsection*{Quality}

Each team member is expected to come to meetings prepared, having completed their assigned work. The work brought to the team should be of high quality, thoroughly tested, and reviewed where applicable.

\subsubsection*{Attitude}

Team members should approach each task with a positive attitude and be open to suggestions and feedback. Collaboration, respect, and a willingness to listen to others are key expectations. Everyone’s ideas should be considered equally.

\subsubsection*{Stay on Track}

To stay on track, the team will use weekly task management tools (such as Trello, Jira or GitHub Issues) to monitor individual progress. Regular check-ins will help ensure members are meeting their targets. If someone consistently underperforms, they will be required to explain their challenges to the team, and corrective actions will be taken, such as redistributing tasks or providing support. Consequences may include minor penalties like bringing coffee to meetings or scheduling a session with the TA or instructor. If a member performs exceptionally well, they may be rewarded with team recognition or other informal incentives like selecting the next team activity.

\subsubsection*{Team Building}

The team will engage in fun activities like online gaming sessions or casual group lunches to build cohesion. Periodically, the team can also celebrate milestones with group outings or social events.

\subsubsection*{Decision Making}

We will aim for consensus in decision-making. However, if disagreements arise and cannot be resolved quickly, we will proceed with a majority vote. For critical decisions, we will ensure that everyone has a chance to voice their opinion, and any unresolved issues can be escalated to the instructor or TA if necessary.
