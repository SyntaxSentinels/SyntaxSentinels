\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
The current code plagiarism dtection tools such as MOSS rely on tokenization and syntax-level comparisons. Although effective
in detecting direct copies or slight variations, they struggle when faced with techniques such as adding redundant code which
allows the user to completely bypass detection while still plagiarizing the underlying logic and structure of the code.

Additionally, MOSS does not take into account for the complexity or intent behind the code, leading to issues such as false
positives for common programming patterns. This creates a gap for more advanced tools capable of understanding the semantic 
meaning of code to more accurately detect plagiarism.
\subsection{The Context of the Work}
Our project aims to address these gaps by incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques
which will be leveraged to improve the accuracy of detecting copied code. The context of the work is within academic institutions,
where the integrity of student work is aparmount and our tool will be used by professors to ensure a fair grading process
while also supporting students in understanding the ethical use of code.
\subsection{Work Partitioning}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Research and Design}: Conduct research on current plagiarism detection systems and state-of-the-art NLP techniques applicable to code plagiarism.
  
  \item \textbf{Data Collection}: Gather a dataset of code snippets, including both plagiarized and original works, to train and test the model.
  
  \item \textbf{Model Development}: Develop the NLP-based model capable of understanding the semantic meaning of code. This may involve exploring techniques like abstract syntax trees (ASTs), vector embeddings, or other representations of code that retain semantic meaning.
  
  \item \textbf{System Integration}: Build the system to take code as input, run through the developed model, and output a similarity score with appropriate thresholds.
  
  \item \textbf{Testing and Validation}: Test the system with various code samples to validate its performance and accuracy compared to traditional systems like MOSS. This will also test wether our method produces any false positives.
  
  \item \textbf{Documentation and Deployment}: Document the system architecture, the model, and the results. Deploy the system for use within academic settings.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Specifying a Business Use Case (BUC)}

\textbf{Business Use Case:} Automated Code Plagiarism Detection for Academic Institutions

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Actors:} Professors, Students, System Administrators
    \item \textbf{Trigger:} A professor or system administrator uploads multiple code submissions for plagiarism detection in a course assignment.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Main Success Scenario}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system ingests the uploaded code submissions.
    \item The system processes each code snippet using the NLP model to generate semantic representations of the code.
    \item The system compares the representations to detect plagiarism, taking into account code similarity beyond syntax or token matching.
    \item The system outputs a similarity score for each comparison, with thresholds indicating whether plagiarism is suspected.
    \item The professor reviews the similarity scores and flags any suspicious cases for further investigation.
    \item The system generates a report summarizing the findings for the professorâ€™s review.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Extensions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the system detects false positives (common programming patterns being flagged as plagiarism), the professor can override the result.
    \item If new sophisticated plagiarism techniques are detected, the system can update its learning algorithms to improve accuracy over time.
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Consistency}: The UI should maintain a uniform color palette, 
    font, and layout across all screens and elements. For instance, the primary 
    color is defined as blue (\#0047AB) for buttons, links, and headers, and 
    white (\#FFFFFF) for background areas.
    
    \item \textbf{Clarity}: All icons, buttons, and menus should be intuitive and 
    clearly identifiable. Hovering over icons will provide tooltips with a brief 
    description of their functionality.
    
    \item \textbf{Responsiveness}: The layout should adjust according to screen 
    size, ensuring the interface remains usable on a range of devices, including 
    desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Style Requirements}
The style guidelines for the interface are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Typography}: The font family used across the UI will be 
    \textit{Roboto}. Headers should use a 24px font size, body text should be 
    14px, and button text should be 16px.
    
    \item \textbf{Color Scheme}: Buttons and interactive elements should use the 
    primary color \#0047AB. Background areas will use \#F0F0F0, and error 
    messages will be highlighted in \#FF0000.
    
    \item \textbf{Button Styles}: All buttons should have rounded corners with 
    a radius of 5px. On hover, the button background will lighten by 20\%.
    
    \item \textbf{Spacing and Padding}: There should be at least 10px of padding 
    between elements and a margin of 20px around each section to maintain a clean 
    layout.
