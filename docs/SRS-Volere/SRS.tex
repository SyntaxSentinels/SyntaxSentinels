\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
The current code plagiarism dtection tools such as MOSS rely on tokenization and syntax-level comparisons. Although effective
in detecting direct copies or slight variations, they struggle when faced with techniques such as adding redundant code which
allows the user to completely bypass detection while still plagiarizing the underlying logic and structure of the code.

Additionally, MOSS does not take into account for the complexity or intent behind the code, leading to issues such as false
positives for common programming patterns. This creates a gap for more advanced tools capable of understanding the semantic 
meaning of code to more accurately detect plagiarism.
\subsection{The Context of the Work}
Our project aims to address these gaps by incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques
which will be leveraged to improve the accuracy of detecting copied code. The context of the work is within academic institutions,
where the integrity of student work is aparmount and our tool will be used by professors to ensure a fair grading process
while also supporting students in understanding the ethical use of code.
\subsection{Work Partitioning}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Research and Design}: Conduct research on current plagiarism detection systems and state-of-the-art NLP techniques applicable to code plagiarism.
  
  \item \textbf{Data Collection}: Gather a dataset of code snippets, including both plagiarized and original works, to train and test the model.
  
  \item \textbf{Model Development}: Develop the NLP-based model capable of understanding the semantic meaning of code. This may involve exploring techniques like abstract syntax trees (ASTs), vector embeddings, or other representations of code that retain semantic meaning.
  
  \item \textbf{System Integration}: Build the system to take code as input, run through the developed model, and output a similarity score with appropriate thresholds.
  
  \item \textbf{Testing and Validation}: Test the system with various code samples to validate its performance and accuracy compared to traditional systems like MOSS. This will also test wether our method produces any false positives.
  
  \item \textbf{Documentation and Deployment}: Document the system architecture, the model, and the results. Deploy the system for use within academic settings.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Specifying a Business Use Case (BUC)}

\textbf{Business Use Case:} Automated Code Plagiarism Detection for Academic Institutions

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Actors:} Professors, Students, System Administrators
    \item \textbf{Trigger:} A professor or system administrator uploads multiple code submissions for plagiarism detection in a course assignment.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Main Success Scenario}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system ingests the uploaded code submissions.
    \item The system processes each code snippet using the NLP model to generate semantic representations of the code.
    \item The system compares the representations to detect plagiarism, taking into account code similarity beyond syntax or token matching.
    \item The system outputs a similarity score for each comparison, with thresholds indicating whether plagiarism is suspected.
    \item The professor reviews the similarity scores and flags any suspicious cases for further investigation.
    \item The system generates a report summarizing the findings for the professorâ€™s review.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Extensions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the system detects false positives (common programming patterns being flagged as plagiarism), the professor can override the result.
    \item If new sophisticated plagiarism techniques are detected, the system can update its learning algorithms to improve accuracy over time.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
