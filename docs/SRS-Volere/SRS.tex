\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}

The Measure of Software Similarity algorithm, or MOSS algorithm for short, is
the current standard for plagiarism detection of code. This
algorithm works by comparing tokenized code snippets and assigning a similarity
score without any weighting based on the complexity of the line being examined.
In other words, there is an inherent lack of semantic understanding of the code
being examined. This gives rise to a major flaw in the MOSS algorithm, which is
that benign lines of code can be added to a program that does not improve or
change functionality but still serves to create an illusion of difference in the
eyes of the algorithm. 

This project seeks to create a plagiarism algorithm that relies on NLP 
techniques of present to account for semantics and prevent primitive 
circumvention of plagiarism detection, such as the addition of benign lines or 
variable name changes. The users of our product will primarily be those 
concerned with fairness and integrity of code submissions within a competitive 
environment, such as professors or code competition holders. 

Users are intended to use the resulting product of our project by giving it
code snippets and receiving a plagiarism report in return. This report will
contain a set of similarity scores for inputted code snippets, which when 
assessed against an outputted threshold will indicate likelihood of plagiarsm
having taken place. This will benefit the users by allowing them to more 
accurately assess the presence of plagiarized work, creating a fairer environment
for competition and rewarding coders correctly. Ultimately, the project aims
to help users achieve an environment that cycles merit instead of cheating, 
which is believed to be a primary interest of users too.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}

\begin{center}
    \begin{longtable}{ | p{3cm} | p{6cm} | p{6cm} | }
    \hline
    \textbf{Goal} & \textbf{Explanation} & \textbf{Reason} \\
    \hline
    Ease of Use & Detector has an intuitive way to insert data and obtain results &
    This application is expected to be used as a secondary tool for
    teachers/professors when administering assignments. It should not require
    in-depth learning or it will be too inconvenient as an assistant tool for
    detecting plagiarism. (Measured by actions to complete analysis)\\
    \hline
    Clarity of Output & Detector explains how to interpret outputs clearly, leaving
    no ambiguity in whether plagiarism is suspected & If the user does not
    comprehend the output, it may result in unjust accusations or undetected
    plagiarism. (Measured by lines of description or number of users who correctly
    interpret output)\\
    \hline
    Real-Time Processing & The detector computes results on a dataset of code
    snippets quickly, enabling professors to incorporate them into evaluations &
    Since multiple assignments are administered over several weeks, the detector
    must be fast enough to be realistic for daily use. (Measured by execution
    time)\\
    \hline
    False Positive Accuracy & The detector prioritizes minimizing false positives over
    false negatives & In this case, a false positive could cause harm to an innocent
    student, while a false negative allows a violation to go unnoticed. The focus is
    on protecting innocent students. (Measured by false positives and negatives
    using recall, precision, etc.)\\
    \hline
    Ethically Sourced Data & The detector uses only data that openly discloses its 
    origins and all data used for the detector is stated for all to see. & In 
    modern ML development, it has become a hot topic for how models get their data.
    This is because many modern models have used datasets that contain information
    that was taken from individuals without consent (such as art). It is
    important to our team to make it clear this is not precedent and that 
    individuals should have clear consent to being used for training models. 
    (Measured by having accreditation for datasets involved in training)\\
    \hline

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | p{3cm} | p{6cm} | p{6cm} | }
    \hline
    \textbf{Stretch Goal} & \textbf{Explanation} & \textbf{Reason} \\
    \hline
    Online Learning & Provide the ability for users to train models on their own datasets. & 
    Without a sufficiently large amount of data to train on (more than will be seen over 8 months), the model will be biased to a degree and not as widely applicable to different sets of code. If the detector is given the ability to be trained by the user, they can better customize it for their own needs (measured by whether or not the user can conduct training)\\
    \hline
    Language Agnostic & The detector can analyze code from a multitude of languages & 
    Having a detector that can draw patterns across different languages will make it adoptable by a wider set of professors who may conduct courses in less popular languages that our detector may have not dealt with at all before. If the detector is restrained to languages such as Python or Java, we will alienate some of our primary stakeholders.\\

\end{itemize}

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The current standard for code plagiarism detection, MOSS, primarily relies on token matching and syntax-based comparison. This method cannot detect deeper semantic similarities in code.
  \item NLP techniques have advanced significantly in recent years, enabling more accurate natural language understanding. These techniques can be adapted to understand the structure and semantics of code, which could enhance plagiarism detection systems.
  \item There is a growing need for a plagiarism detection system that accounts for sophisticated plagiarism techniques, such as variable renaming, code restructuring, and adding non-functional code.
  \item Academic institutions are increasingly concerned with the fairness and accuracy of plagiarism detection systems to avoid penalizing students unfairly, especially with the rising prevalence of online and remote learning.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Business Rules}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system must ensure compliance with data protection regulations by following a zero data retention policy.
  \item The similarity threshold for flagging plagiarism should be customizable by the institution or professor, allowing flexibility based on course policies.
  \item False positives (e.g., common code patterns) should be minimized, with options for professors to override flagged instances and manually validate the results.
  \item The system must be scalable to accommodate large datasets and multiple users submitting code for comparison at the same time.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item It is assumed that the academic institutions adopting this system have clear plagiarism policies and can provide a threshold score that reflects their definitions of plagiarism.
  \item It is assumed that the code samples provided for comparison are original and not previously processed by other plagiarism detection systems, ensuring that the results reflect real-time analysis.
  \item It is assumed that professors and administrators will review flagged cases manually to confirm plagiarism before taking disciplinary action.
  \item It is assumed that students will not have access to the internal workings of the plagiarism detection algorithm, preventing them from finding potential loopholes to bypass detection.
  \item Software will be used only in Canada, and the legal and ethical considerations of this country will be taken into account during development.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
The current code plagiarism detection tools such as MOSS rely on tokenization and syntax-level comparisons. Although effective
in detecting direct copies or slight variations, they struggle when faced with techniques such as adding redundant code which
allows the user to completely bypass detection while still plagiarizing the underlying logic and structure of the code.

Additionally, MOSS does not take into account the complexity or intent behind the code, leading to issues such as false
positives for common programming patterns. This creates a gap for more advanced tools capable of understanding the semantic 
meaning of code to more accurately detect plagiarism.
\subsection{The Context of the Work}
Our project aims to address these gaps by incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques
which will be leveraged to improve the accuracy of detecting copied code. The context of the work is within academic institutions,
where the integrity of student work is paramount and our tool will be used by professors to ensure a fair grading process
while also supporting students in understanding the ethical use of code.
\subsection{Work Partitioning}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Research and Design}: Research current plagiarism detection systems and state-of-the-art NLP techniques applicable to code plagiarism.
  
  \item \textbf{Data Collection}: Gather a dataset of code snippets, including both plagiarized and original works, to train and test the model.
  
  \item \textbf{Model Development}: Develop the NLP-based model capable of understanding the semantic meaning of code. This may involve exploring techniques like abstract syntax trees (ASTs), vector embeddings, or other representations of code that retain semantic meaning.
  
  \item \textbf{System Integration}: Build the system to take code as input, run through the developed model, and output a similarity score with appropriate thresholds.
  
  \item \textbf{Testing and Validation}: Test the system with various code samples to validate its performance and accuracy compared to traditional systems like MOSS. This will also test whether our method produces any false positives.
  
  \item \textbf{Documentation and Deployment}: Document the system architecture, the model, and the results. Deploy the system for use within academic settings.
\end{itemize}

    Justification - While no user data is retained, logging system events and user actions provide a transparent way to track system usage and ensure accountability without violating the zero data retention policy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Immunity Requirements}
Immunity requirements are beyond the scope of this project. The system should not need to defend against external attacks
beyond the security measures already in place (e.g., authentication, encryption).
The focus of the project is on code plagiarism detection, and immunity against malicious actors is not a primary concern.

\section{Cultural Requirements}
\subsection{Cultural Requirements}
No major cultural requirements are identified for this project but some that could be taken into consideration are:\\ \\ 
\noindent \textbf{Data Privacy and Ethical Use}\\ 
\textbf{Student Privacy}: In some cultures and institutions, the handling of student work and data is highly regulated. Laws like the FIPPA mandate strict data privacy standards. The system should ensure that student data, including their code submissions, is securely handled, anonymized where possible, and not stored unnecessarily.
\\ \\
\noindent \textbf{Differences in Academic Integrity Norms}\\ 
\textbf{Varying Definitions of Plagiarism}: Some cultures and institutions promote collaboration and code borrowing so it is essential to define what plagiarism is in the context of this project. The tool should also be modifiable in its threshold for detecting plagiarism so institutions can change it to their needs.


\section{Compliance Requirements}

In developing the enhanced plagiarism detection tool, it is imperative to address
various compliance requirements to ensure the tool operates legally, ethically,
and in alignment with industry standards. These requirements encompass legal
obligations related to data protection, intellectual property rights, and

    information, including students' code submissions, which may be considered personal
    data under Canadian privacy laws such as the \textit{Personal Information Protection 
    and Electronic Documents Act} (PIPEDA) at the federal level, and Ontario's \textit{Freedom of 
    Information and Protection of Privacy Act} (FIPPA) for public institutions. Compliance with these 
    laws require:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Lawful Basis for Data Processing}: Ensuring that the collection and use of 
        personal information is authorized under PIPEDA or FIPPA, typically requiring consent from 
        students before processing their code or ensuring that processing is necessary for educational purposes.
        \item \textbf{Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation}: Collecting only the data
        necessary for plagiarism detection and using it solely for that purpose.
        \item \textbf{Transparency and Information Rights}: Informing students about how
        their data will be used, stored, and protected, and respecting their rights to
        access, correct, or withdraw their personal information.
        \item \textbf{Security Measures}: Implementing appropriate technical and
        organizational measures to safeguard personal data against unauthorized access,
        loss, or disclosure, as required under PIPEDA and FIPPA.

        outlining how the code will be used, ensuring students are aware and consent to
        these terms.
        \item \textbf{Avoid Infringement}: Ensure that any storage or processing of code
        does not violate the \textit{Copyright Act} or institutional policies.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{CR-L3: Academic Integrity Policies}: The tool must align with the academic
    integrity and misconduct policies of Canadian educational institutions by:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Supporting Fair Evaluation}: Assisting educators in identifying
        potential plagiarism accurately without bias.
        \item \textbf{Due Process}: Ensuring that students have the opportunity to respond
        to plagiarism accusations, with results from the tool serving as part of a broader
        investigation rather than definitive proof.
        \item \textbf{Confidentiality}: Maintaining the confidentiality of students' work
        and any findings related to plagiarism investigations.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Standards Compliance Requirements}

             maintainable, and scalable code.
            \item \textbf{Documentation and Testing}: Thorough documentation will be maintained throughout 
            development, and rigorous testing will be conducted to validate the tool's performance and reliability.
        \end{itemize}



    \item \textbf{CR-SC2: Data Security Standards}: Protecting sensitive data is a priority, and although full 
    compliance with industry security standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 may not be feasible for a student 
    capstone project, we will take measures to ensure data security.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{OWASP Guidelines}: Basic security measures will be implemented in line with the 
            Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) guidelines to mitigate common vulnerabilities such 
            as injection attacks and unauthorized access.
        \end{itemize}

        are transparent in their operation and that their decision-making processes can be
        explained to users.
        \item \textbf{Fairness and Non-Discrimination}: Preventing biases in the AI models
        that could unfairly target or disadvantage any group of students. Ensuring that names
        and other potentially discriminatory information are not used in the detection process.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{CR-SC5: Data Handling and Retention Policies}: Establishing clear policies for
    how data is managed throughout its lifecycle.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Zero Data Retention}: No user data will be retained beyond the immediate needs of the task.
        All user-uploaded data will be immediately loaded into memory and subsequently removed from disk as soon
        as the task is finished.
        \item \textbf{Secure Disposal}: Implementing procedures for the secure deletion or
        anonymization of data that is no longer needed.
        \item \textbf{Audit and Compliance}: Regularly auditing data handling practices to
        ensure compliance with all relevant laws and standards.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

project not only safeguards the rights and interests of all stakeholders but also
enhances the credibility and trustworthiness of the plagiarism detection tool. Ensuring
compliance is fundamental to the tool's success and its acceptance by educational
institutions, educators, and students alike.


\section{Open Issues}
\subsection{System Design Uncertainty}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How the integration of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) model with the code submission system will work. Such as choosing what NLP model to use, how to train it, and where to host it.
    \item Selecting the most appropriate techniques for semantic code analysis, such as Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) or vector embeddings.
    \item Deciding on how the model will handle false positives, especially common coding patterns, to avoid misclassification: for instance, students using the same code snippets from a tutorial.
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Data Collection Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
    \item While the project mentions scraping datasets from online programming contests and using pre-labeled datasets, 
    there could be issues with data availability, quality, or ensuring that the data accurately reflects real-world usage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Scalability Concerns}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensuring the system remains performant when processing large batches of submissions within the 10-minute processing time goal. 
    Handling larger academic institutions with potentially thousands of submissions may challenge the current system's capacity requirements
    \item  Given the limited budget for cloud compute units, it may be challenging to balance performance improvements with cost constraints. 
    If training processes requires more resources than anticipated, costs could quickly escalate.
\end{itemize}
\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}

Many ready-made tools aim to detect source-code level plagiarism, the most well-known of which being \href{https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/}{MOSS}. MOSS is most commonly used by professors.
There are also a handful of open-source alternatives, including: \href{https://github.com/jplag/JPlag}{JPlag}, \href{https://dickgrune.com/Programs/similarity_tester/}{SIM}, \href{https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/ias/software/sherlock/}{Sherlock}, and \href{https://www.cs.hut.fi/Software/Plaggie/}{Plaggie}.
Most of them support checking multiple languages and use a variety of techniques to improve detection rates. These tools are relatively old and are not all actively developed.

\subsection{Reusable Components}

JPlag uses ANTLR 4 as a parser generator for many of its supported languages. For cross-language support, our tool can reuse JPlag's ANTLR grammar files to create language frontend parsers for each language we choose to support. Using a parser generator with pre-existing grammar files would reduce development time significantly since the alternative would entail writing a custom parser for each supported language. By using ANTLR and JPlag's grammar files, we could feasibly support many source languages as opposed to just one, which would most likely be Python (our product will be written in Python, and Python is capable of parsing its own syntax tree).

\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}

The primary inspiration for our product is MOSS. Our product, similar to many others, will copy the general data pipeline of input source code. Specifically, after reading an input source code file, plagiarism checkers typically have parsing, tokenizing, and normalizing steps. This is followed by some analysis on the normalized text - \href{https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/publications/papers/sigmod03.pdf}{MOSS uses "Winnowing"}, an algorithm that produces local fingerprints in a piece of text.

To reduce development time, we plan to copy the first step (the text preprocessing as described above) of the data pipeline implemented in MOSS. This kind of text normalization is commonly studied and there are many resources that explain implementation details.

\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Blind Trust in the Tool}: One potential issue is that users may develop a sense of over-reliance on the tool based solely on the fact that it is AI-based. This can lead to blind trust in its results. This could cause professors to forego manual checks, resulting in incorrect classifications.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
There should be no new problems for users of this tool since they don't need to install any software on their local machines. The tool's interface is accessed by a web browser, and the processing happens on the server side.

\subsection{Potential User Problems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Difficulty with the New UI}: Some users may struggle to navigate the new UI, resulting in misuse of the tool. Additionally, some settings may not be known by the user and left at their default value, which may cause confusion or result in a worse detection rate.

    \item \textbf{Misinterpretation of Results}: Users may incorrectly interpret the significance of the results provided by the tool. For instance, a high similarity score might be misinterpreted as definitive proof of plagiarism when there could be legitimate reasons for the similarity, such as the use of common libraries or design patterns.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Limited Compute Power Causing Delays}: If the system is deployed in environments with limited computational resources, such as local servers with insufficient processing power or memory, users may experience longer waiting times for results. Additionally, high computational demands may overload the system during peak usage times, also resulting in longer waiting times.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Server Maintenance and Costs}: Long-term maintenance of the server infrastructure could present challenges, including server downtime, performance degradation, and increasing operational costs as more users adopt the system. Costs related to server hosting, cloud processing, and ensuring uptime can grow as demand increases.
    
    \item \textbf{Model Upgrades and Performance Regressions}: Updating or training new models may introduce performance regressions or unexpected behaviour in the plagiarism detection system. For example, a newer model may detect plagiarism more accurately but at the cost of higher processing times or an increase in false positives.
\end{itemize}

\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
The migration to the new code plagiarism detection system must be carefully planned and executed to ensure smooth adoption by academic institutions. The following requirements should be addressed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Training and Support}: Provide comprehensive documentation and training materials for professors, system administrators, and students to familiarize them with the new system. This includes tutorials on how to upload code, interpret results, and resolve flagged cases.
    \item \textbf{Phased Rollout}: Implement a phased migration plan, starting with pilot tests in a controlled environment (e.g., one course or department) before full-scale implementation across the institution.
    \item \textbf{Data Security Compliance}: Ensure data migrations comply with data protection regulations, such as Canada's Privacy Act.
    \item \textbf{System Downtime Minimization}: Plan the migration to minimize downtime and disruption to academic workflows. Ideally, the transition should occur during a break period, when student and faculty activity is low.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
For the migration to the new plagiarism detection system, certain data from the legacy systems must be modified or translated to ensure compatibility:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Code Submissions}: Legacy code submissions must be translated into a format that the new system can process, especially if the old system uses proprietary formats or different programming language encoding.
    \item \textbf{User Permissions}: Any user and administrator accounts need to be transferred to the new system. This includes roles, permissions, and access levels.
    \item \textbf{Configuration Data}: Settings from the old system, such as threshold scores, course configurations, and institution-specific policies, must be mapped and adjusted to fit the new system’s configuration parameters.
    \item \textbf{Metadata and Logs}: Metadata (e.g., anonymous submission timestamps, course IDs) and system logs related to prior plagiarism checks should be preserved and transferred, ensuring transparency and continuity.
\end{itemize}

\section{Costs}
The costs associated with this project come from several different parts of the project.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data must be acquired before training the model. The data required to
    train the model can cost money. However, the team intends to automate
    processes to acquire data, and thus there is no charge incurred. An unknown
    amount of money will be needed for data if the team's method of acquiring
    data fails.
    \item In the training and testing phase, the model will require hardware to
    be trained on. The team intends to use Google Co-lab and leverage the
    hardware provided by their cloud platform. This will cost approximately 30
    dollars for the required computation. However, if more training and testing
    is required, more Google compute units will be used, costing more money. An
    upper limit of 150 dollars is set, which is 5 times more than the current
    guess. 
    \item The front end will need to be hosted somewhere. However, free
    alternatives exist, thus this will have no cost incurred.

\end{itemize}
In total, the project should only cost approximately 30 dollars. The cost is
subject to change, and can increase/decrease depending on the amount of data
needed, and how much Google's cloud hardware is used.

\section{User Documentation and Training}

\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}
The user documentation must be comprehensive, detailing all functionalities of the system. It should include step-by-step guides for professors, system administrators, and competition organizers, ensuring they can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Upload code submissions for plagiarism checks.
    \item Understand the process behind similarity score generation.
    \item Review and interpret similarity reports.
    \item Adjust plagiarism detection thresholds to suit specific needs.
    \item Administer the system, including managing users, system settings, and troubleshooting common issues.
\end{itemize}

The documentation should also include a frequently asked questions (FAQ) section, covering common user issues, and should be available in both written and video tutorial formats.

\subsection{Training Requirements}
The system requires training sessions for all primary users, including professors, competition organizers, and system administrators. Training should focus on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How to upload and submit code for plagiarism checking.
    \item How to review and interpret similarity scores and plagiarism reports.
    \item Techniques for flagging plagiarism cases and overriding false positives.
    \item Administrative training for system administrators, covering user management, and system maintenance.
    \item Ongoing support for users, including refresher training and updates on new features as the system evolves.
\end{itemize}

Training materials should be available in multiple formats: in-person workshops, webinars, and self-paced online courses.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain-specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \textbf{Knowledge Areas:}

        \item \textbf{Language normalization}: Understanding source-code level processing techniques necessary for transforming input text into a format usable by NLP models.
        \item \textbf{NLP Techniques}: Understanding and applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze code submissions. Necessary to develop algorithm/model project will rely on at its core.
        \item \textbf{Server Deployment}: Understanding how to deploy algorithm/model in conjunction with UI to receive 
        requests for analyzing plagiarism from a non-local user. Necessary to be able to host our model outside of a local host.
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Skills:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Writing}: The ability to convey thoughts in a formalized manner. This is necessary to write documentation for projects such as SRS.
        \item \textbf{Team Management}: The ability to delegate responsibilities amongst members in a respectful manner while working off feedback from teammates about their enjoyment of given tasks to retain a cohesive team dynamic. This is necessary to keep work on track and maintain an enthusiastic team spirit.
        \item \textbf{Proactive Communication}: Letting others know in advance the direction you want to head in for a given task. This is necessary to allow strong planning that will not crumble under roadblocks in code development, which are bound to happen.
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Julian}: Server Deployment, Proactive Communication \\
    \textbf{Lucas}: NLP Techniques, Team Management \\
    \textbf{Dennis}: NLP Techniques, Team Management \\
    \textbf{Mohammad}: NLP Techniques, Writing, Proactive Communication
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Server Deployment}: YouTube Videos, Online Articles, Building miniproject
        \item \textbf{Proactive Communication}: Scheduling Meetings for direction, Notebook Reminders
        \item \textbf{Language normalization}: YouTube Videos, Research Papers, Open source code on GitHub

        \item \textbf{Writing}: Writing Documentation, Online Articles
        \item \textbf{Proactive Communication}: Notebook Reminders, Scheduling Meetings
    \end{itemize}
    Which team member chose to pursue which approach, and why?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Lucas Chen:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{NLP Techniques}: Lucas will pursue YouTube videos and online reading to understand NLP techniques. This is because he learns best through visual and auditory methods.
            \item \textbf{Team Management}: Lucas will pursue learning more about GitHub project management tools and techniques. This is because he has taken on the role of project manager and needs to understand how to manage the team effectively.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Dennis Fong:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{NLP Techniques}: Dennis will look for research papers on NLP, especially ones that pertain to the topic of this project. This is because he seeks a deeper understanding of the inner workings of a NLP model from both a math and code perspective.
            \item \textbf{Team Management}: Dennis will learn about team management through the use of GitHub and the many features it supports for managing a project for the team. He is not as familiar with GitHub as his team members, and this will serve as a strong learning experience.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Julian Cecchini:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Server Deployment}: Julian will pursue online articles to learn this. He finds maintaining attention for long YouTube videos can be cumbersome and if he's interrupted, it's easier to find where he left off in online articles compared to YouTube videos. Also, he doesn't feel he has time to trial server deployment in as a side project. He lacks experience in server deployment compared to the rest of the team, so he seeks to close the knowledge gap to be able to contribute and gain experience in this area.

            \item \textbf{Proactive Communication}: Julian will schedule meetings for thought direction on given tasks. He feels the commitment imposed by a meeting where he must announce his thoughts will have him try more consistently to announce his mind's direction than a notebook reminder that suggests he should bring some thoughts forward. He feels its essential he masters this while dealing with multiple extracurriculars on top of capstone so he doesn't lose touch with the team.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Mohammad Mohsin Khan:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{NLP Techniques}: Mohammad will pursue online articles and research papers to understand NLP techniques. This is because he prefers to read and analyze information at his own pace.
            \item \textbf{Writing}: Mohammad will practice writing by creating documentation for the project. This hands-on approach will help him improve his writing skills through practical application.
            \item \textbf{Proactive Communication}: Mohammad will use notebook reminders to prompt him to communicate proactively. This method aligns with his preference for written reminders and will help him stay organized and on track.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Luigi Quattrociocchi:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Language normalization}: Luigi will study open-source repositories on GitHub and read research papers relating to source-code-level language processing. This knowledge will be critical to transforming user input into a format that is usable for NLP analysis. This choice was made because Luigi has many ideas for the implementation of these techniques and he believes that formalizing this will help the project proceed.
            \item \textbf{Server Deployment}: Luigi aims to improve his knowledge of server deployment and general web development best practices and techniques by watching YouTube videos and participating in discussions with the team about how we plan to deploy the system. Luigi finds that he lacks expertise in this area and would like to contribute to this aspect of the project.
            \item \textbf{Writing}: Luigi will pursue improvement in writing by continuing to write documentation and enforcing strict linter rules about comments and function docstrings in the project source code. This will help him improve his communication with his team and improve documentation for any other maintainers of the project.
        \end{itemize}
