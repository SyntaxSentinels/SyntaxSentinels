\section{CICD}

The project will use continuous integration and continuous deployment (CICD) to run tests and deploy the software.
The steps in the CICD pipeline are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Developer creates PR and CICD pipeline will trigger phase 0.
  \item Phase 0 will run build and check if the build is successful.
  \item If the build is successful, reviewer will review the PR.
  \item If the reviewer approves the PR, the CICD pipeline will trigger phase 1.
  \item Phase 1 will run tests and check if the tests are successful.
  \item If the tests are successful, the CICD pipeline will trigger phase 2.
  \item Phase 2 will merge and deploy the software.
\end{enumerate}
