\section{CICD}

In our project, we use CI/CD pipelines to automate various tasks and streamline our workflow. Specifically:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GitHub Actions for LaTeX Compilation}: We have a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically compiles our LaTeX documents into PDFs whenever changes are pushed, ensuring that our documentation is always up to date.
    \item \textbf{Frontend Deployment}: We use CI/CD to automatically deploy our frontend application whenever changes are merged into the \texttt{main} branch. This ensures that the latest version is always live without manual intervention.
    \item \textbf{Branch Deployments}: For feature branches, we have CI/CD workflows that deploy changes to a staging environment, allowing us to test new features before merging them into \texttt{main}.
\end{itemize}
