\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}
The current methods that exist for plagiarism detection of code has many flaws that make it easily bypassable. A coder can add lines of code that do nothing to some original snippet of code, and the MOSS (Measure of Software Similarity) plagiarism detector will not detect any form of plagiarism between the two. This is an inherent problem that arises from the use of algorithmic solutions; these solutions lack semantic understanding. With how easy it is to plagiarize, students who shouldn't be graduating are able to graduate by putting in a fraction of the work of other students. 

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}
The problem will take two snippets of code to compare for plagiarism. The desired output is a decision on whether or not the two snippets were plagiarized from one another. 
\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}
The main stakeholders in this project are professors in any computing and software department, and students enrolled in courses where coding is prevalent. Professors have been identified as stakeholders since they are the people who will be looking out for plagiarism to ensure people don't do it in their courses. This project provides a tool to give professors the ability to make better predictions on plagiarism. Students have also been identified as stakeholders, since students mostly work very hard to complete their degree. It is unfair to them when there are those who can plagiarize and achieve the same results as them, with half the effort.

\subsection{Environment}
This solution will operate on a device, where two files will be fed to a model. The model will leverage hardware provided on the cloud.

\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
