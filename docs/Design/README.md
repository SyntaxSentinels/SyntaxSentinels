# Design Documentation

The folders and files for this folder are as follows:


- SoftArchitecture (MG.tex): The module guide (MG) provides a comprehensive module guide detailing the software architecture, including the module hierarchy, anticipated and unlikely changes, and the connections between requirements and design. It serves as a roadmap for understanding the modular structure of the system.

- SoftDetailedDesign (MIS.tex): The Module Interface Specification (MIS) outlines the specifications for each module within the system. It includes details on module decomposition, exported access programs, state variables, and the semantics of each module, ensuring clarity on how modules interact and function within the overall architecture.
