\section{Introduction}

% \wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}
A hazard is a property or condition in the system together with a condition in the environment that has the potential to cause harm, disrupt operations, 
or negatively affect the functionality of a system. Hazards can arise from various sources, including system 
malfunctions, human errors, environmental factors, or security vulnerabilities.

This document is the hazard analysis for the Capstone SyntaxSentinels. This project seeks to create a plagiarism algorithm that relies on NLP
techniques of present to account for semantics and prevent primitive circumvention of plagiarism detection, such as the addition of benign lines or
variable name changes.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adequate computational resources exist for the real time analysis of the code snippets
    \item Users do not intend to misuse the product
    \item Third party resources that support this product will always be functionally correct
    \item All components on the cloud will provide sufficient scalability and security
    \item The system will be maintained regularly with bug fixes/performance enhancements
    \item The criteria for plagiarism is agreed upon by all users
\end{itemize}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}
